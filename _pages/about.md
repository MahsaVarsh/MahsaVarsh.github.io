I am an assistant professor in [Software Quality Research group](https://square.itu.dk/){:target="\_blank"} at IT University of Copenhagen. My research is mostly focused on quality assurance and safety of software systems. I am interested in both theoretical and practical aspects of modeling, testing and verification of systems and the challenges in application of such techniques in different domains. I have experience with application of model-based testing techniques for families of software systems also known as software product lines. My latest research includes testing of underwater robotic systems in REMARO project and automatic program repair for Linux kernel as a part of INSIGH project.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `my_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
